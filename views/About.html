         <h2>About</h2>
         <p>This project gives us analysis on how a driver can be quantified based on his driving skills to offer insurance. Instead of deciding it based on the price, telematics gives us the opportunity 
to analyze and measure the behavior of the driver's quality to issue insurance policies. This can lead to savings for safe or infrequent drivers, and transition the burden to policies that represent increased liability. </p>
<p>
Different types of patterns of the drivers data set are displayed in form of charts. Some of the patterns displayed are Driver's Driving path based on the co-ordinates that we have, Drivers that portray harsh accelerations,
drivers that maintain average speed in the city, drivers whose speed is high and also their brake ratio on highway. Various metrics like these contribute in scoring a driver which allows to decide the pricing of insurance.
